# Project on Tartu Smart Bike data analysis
## Introduction to Data Science - LTAT.02.002


In `Rental_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook file we have done the smart bike rental data analysis.  
In `Heatmaps.ipynb` notebook file we did heat maps using the smart bike locations data and Google Maps API.  
There are further comments and explanations in both notebooks and **if You possess the confidential data of Smart Bike given to You by Tartu city** you are able to fully run both notebooks by selecting Kernel -> Restart & Run All.
